#Installing Spark 1.2.0 on HDP 2.2

After SSH'ing into your Sandbox, use `su` to login as root.
Now let's get the bits using the command

```
wget http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/HDP-LABS/Projects/spark/1.2.0/spark-1.2.0.2.2.0.0-82-bin-2.6.0.2.2.0.0-2041.tgz
```

Then uncompress the archive with

```
tar xvfz spark-1.2.0.2.2.0.0-82-bin-2.6.0.2.2.0.0-2041.tgz
```

Move the resulting folder to `/opt` as just `spark`

```
mv spark-1.2.0.2.2.0.0-82-bin-2.6.0.2.2.0.0-2041 /opt/spark
```

also for good measure create a symbolic link from `/usr/hdp/current/spark-client` into `/opt/spark`

```
ln -s /opt/spark /usr/hdp/current/spark-client
```
